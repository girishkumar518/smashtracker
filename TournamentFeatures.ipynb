    "# 📘 How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "**Welcome!** If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, here is a quick guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Cells**: This document is divided into blocks called \"cells\". Some are text (like this one) and some are code.\n",
    "2.  **Running Code**: To run a code cell, click inside it and press the **Play Button (▶)** on the left side of the cell, or press `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard.\n",
    "3.  **Order Matters**: Run the cells from top to bottom. The computer needs to \"remember\" the definitions in the first cells to make the later cells work.\n",
    "4.  **Outputs**: The results of the code (like \"Created Club: Badminton Smashers\") will appear immediately below the cell you ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of this Notebook**: We are using this to *test* the logic for Tournaments (creating brackets, deciding winners) in simple Python code before we spend hours building the complex Mobile App screens. It's a sandbox! 🏖️"
